Hey everyone!
This is a simple program called "FileHider" that allows users to hide any file after running it.

**Acknowledgment**
The system must have Java JDK and MySQL installed.
Make sure to create a database in MySQL named 'file_hider_data' using the following command:
**CREATE DATABASE file_hider_data;**
You can run this program in any IDE, but IntelliJ IDEA is recommended for better performance.
